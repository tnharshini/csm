            <h2>Wastes and Recycling</h2>
            <h3>Biodegradable</h3>
            <h3>What does Biodegradable mean?</h3>
            <h3>Definition</h3>
            <p>A biodegradable material can be defined as a material which can be decomposed by bacteria or other natural organisms and not be added to pollution.<br>
                
                Biodegradable wastes are such waste materials which are and can be degraded by natural factors like microbes (e.g. bacteria, fungi and a few more), and abiotic elements like temperature, UV, oxygen, etc. Some examples of such wastes are food materials, kitchen wastes, and other natural wastes. Microorganisms and other abiotic factors together break down complex substances into simpler organic matter, which eventually suspend and fade into the soil. The whole process is natural, which can be rapid or slow. Therefore, the environmental issues and risks caused by biodegradable wastes are low.</p>
                
                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <p>Huge dumping of waste can raise some threats to life sooner or later. To avoid this, some people practise composting. In composting, the biodegradable wastes are dumped into a pit and covered for a period. Due to the action of microbes, they will decompose and will be used as manure for cultivation purposes. This will reduce the amount of waste in landfills.</p>
                <h3>What is Biodegradable Waste?</h3>
                <p>Biodegradable waste is a type of waste, typically originating from plant or animal sources, which may be degraded by other living organisms.<br>
                
                Biodegradable waste can be commonly found in municipal solid waste as green waste, food waste, paper waste and biodegradable plastics. Other biodegradable wastes include human waste, manure, sewage, and slaughterhouse waste.</p>
                
                <h3>Non-Biodegradable</h3>
                <h3>What does Non-biodegradable mean?</h3>
                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>A Non-Biodegradable material can be defined as a kind of substance which cannot be broken down by natural organisms and acts as a source of pollution.<br>
                
                Unlike biodegradable wastes, non-biodegradable cannot be easily handled. Non-biodegradable wastes are those that cannot be decomposed or dissolved by natural agents. They remain on earth for thousands of years without any degradation. Hence, the threat caused by them is also more critical. A notable example is plastics which are a commonly used material in almost every field. To give these plastics a long-lasting effect, improved quality plastics are being put to use. This made them more temperature resistant and more durable even after use. Other examples are cans, metals, and chemicals for agricultural and industrial purposes. They are the main causes of air, water and soil pollution and diseases like cancer.<br>
                
                Since non-biodegradable wastes are not Eco-friendly, they need to be replaced. As a part of the development of alternatives, scientists have brought forward many ideas like biodegradable plastics, etc. They incorporated some biodegradable materials with plastics and made them easily and rapidly degradable. But this is quite an expensive procedure.</p>
                
                <h3>What is Non-Biodegradable waste?</h3>
                <p>Waste that cannot be decomposed by biological processes is known as “Non-biodegradable wastes”. Most of the inorganic waste is non-biodegradable. Non-biodegradable wastes that can be recycled are known as “Recyclable waste” and those which cannot be recycled are known as “Non-recyclable waste”.</p>
                <h3>Environment</h3>
                <p>Waste quantities are generally growing in all countries all around the world. Every year billions of tons of waste are generated. These wastes are the result of activities in our homes, businesses and industries and the disposal of this large amount is an enormous environmental problem with many dimensions. Municipal, industrial and agricultural solid waste and biomass deposits cause large-scale pollution of land and water. The generation of waste causes a loss of materials and energy and increases environmental costs on society for its collection, treatment and disposal. The impacts of landfills and incineration are significant because of their potential for greenhouse gas emissions (methane, carbon dioxide) and transboundary migration of organic micro-pollutants (dioxins and furans) and volatile heavy metals. Problems with waste are as old as the human race.<br>
                
                <p>Very soon, humans realized that waste is a potential source of diseases and infections, so they dumped their waste, which was totally biological, away from their settlements. The first organized municipal dump was in 500 BC outside ancient Athens in Greece, where regulations required waste to be dumped at least a mile from the city limits and covered with soil (Vuk, 1995). Until the industrialization of society, waste was mostly organic so that it could decompose naturally. Later, mostly because of industrialization, urbanization, and the development of consumer society amount of waste increased very fast.</p>
                
                <h3>Treatments</h3>
                <p>Whether it is biodegradable or non-biodegradable, they harm human life and ruin other organisms and their environment. Thus, proper treatment of waste has to be done. This is not only the responsibility of the Government but of every individual as well. The three Rs- Recycle, Reuse, and Reduce are the simplest steps which can be followed by each person to do their part. This can save energy and other resources as well. Another step is separate biodegradable from non-biodegradable at home and dispose of them separately.</p>
            <h3>What is recycling?</h3>
                <p>Recycling is taking waste or discarded material and turning it into something new. For instance, instead of throwing that plastic water bottle into the trash, it can be recycled and made into a new bottle or other plastic item. Your old magazines might visit your house again as part of your cereal box.
                    <h3>Learning About Recycling</h3>

<p></p>We’ve all be taught that recycling is good for the planet. We see commercials about recycling on TV and billboards in our community. We’ve seen recycling containers in public places and we might recycle in our own homes. But, have you ever stopped to think why we recycle? What does recycling really mean? What are the real benefits?

            <h2>Recyclable Wastes</h2>
            <h3>What can be recycled?</h3>
                <p>
                    Lots of what we think of as trash can be recycled. The EPA has stated that up to 75% of what we throw away could be recycled, yet we actually only recycle about 30%. Recyclable items include:</p>    
                    <ol>
                        <li>metals – aluminium (beverage cans), tin, steel (canned food)</li>
                        <li>paper- cardboard, cereal boxes, office paper, magazines, newspapers, junk mail</li>
                        <li>glass</li>
                        <li>plastics</li>
                        <li>electronics</li>
                    <li>batteries</li>
                <li>food</li></ol>
                    <p>Not all municipalities have recycling programs in place for each of these. Check with your local recycle center or municipality.</p>

            <h2>Uses</h2>
            <p><h2>Benefits Of Recycling</h2>
                We say recycling is good for the planet, but what does that mean? What good can saving something from the trash really do? According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), recycling benefits the Earth in these ways:<br><br>
                *Reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills and incinerators<br>
                *Conserves natural resources such as timber, water, and minerals<br>
                *Prevents pollution by reducing the need to collect new raw materials<br>
                *Saves energy<br>
                *Reduces greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global climate change<br>
                *Helps sustain the environment for future generations<br>
                *Helps create new well-paying jobs in the recycling and manufacturing industries in the United States.<br>
                
                <h2>Benefits of Waste Management</h2>
                No matter what industry you’re in, from manufacturing or medical to agricultural or energy production, you produce waste. Take a look at these seven benefits of implementing industrial recycling into your waste management program. There are many elements that make up waste management, including water treatment, providing roll off dumpsters and consulting.
                
                <h4>1. Reduce Costs</h4>
                There are costs associated with disposing of unused materials and commercial by-products. By finding ways to reuse waste, inside your company or through a third-party, you can help to reduce these expenses and improve your bottom line.
                
                Additionally, you can also reduce costs by purchasing raw materials made from recycled materials. Aluminum, for example, is one of the fastest and easiest materials to recycle and is used in numerous manufacturing industries. But you’re paying almost twice as much when you purchase fresh aluminum over recycled aluminum.
                
                <h4>2. Save Resources and Energy</h4>
                The most important benefit of industrial recycling is the fact that you are putting less strain on the Earth’s resources by finding ways to reuse or recycle industrial waste. When industrial waste materials and by-products are reused, it decreases the need to produce new raw materials. Less waste also lessens our need for landfills, allowing that land to be used for other purposes, and reduces the greenhouse emissions and other gas pollutants that originate as waste in landfills breaks down.
                
                Using the EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM) tool you can put concrete numbers to your waste reduction efforts. With the tool, you can calculate the amount of greenhouse gas emissions you prevented through alternative recycling or reuse methods.
                
                <h4>3. Create a Sustainable Brand</h4>
                social benefits of sustainable business 
                When your business strives to be sustainable, you can anticipate that there will be social benefits of industrial recycling too. It shows a commitment to the future of your community, which can be easily become a competitive advantage over the rest of the market.
                
                A 2014 ranking of the 50 Best Global Green Brands, measured on sustainability efforts and public perception, featured four automotive brands in the top five, followed by three electronics brands. Two industries that have long carried a stigma of being environmentally unfriendly are now reaping the benefits of making sustainable changes.
                
                Make your business sustainable by utilizing Waste-to-Energy recycling.
                
            <h4>4. Create New Jobs</h4>
                The process of recycling industrial waste includes transportation, processing, and reselling; all of which necessitate manpower of all skill levels. Recycling and reuse creates at least nine times more jobs (up to 30x more jobs at the most!) than landfills and incinerators. Additionally, it’s projected that if the U.S. can reach a 75% recycling rate by 2013, we can create 1.1 million new jobs.
                
                <h4>5. Be More Efficient</h4>
                When waste is not properly cared for, you can run into issues in the future that require time and money to resolve. When you introduce waste management practices, you can run your business more efficiently and allocate resources to growth initiatives rather than disaster response.
                
                <h4>6. Stay Compliant</h4>
                Local, state and federal governments require various waste practices for community safety and environmental concerns. These requirements will vary between industries based on the waste different operations create. Responsible waste management can help your operation comply with these regulations and prevent penalties in the future.
                
                <h4>7. Meet Green Building Certification Requirements</h4>
                The U.S. Green Building Council gives companies certifications based on their environmental practices. Waste management planning plays a role in this certification, and with the right approach, your company can become certified. Doing so can make your company more competitive in its industry and improve your building’s operational efficiency.</p>
